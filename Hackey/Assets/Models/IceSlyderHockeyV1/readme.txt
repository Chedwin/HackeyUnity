"Ice Slyder" Hockey Pack Volume 1
---------------------------------

The package includes:

- 1 Hockey Dude model.
- 27 Animations & Transitions (Slow Skate, Fast Skate, Idle, Check, Shoot, Pass, Stop, and Score!)
- 7 Canadian-themed skins.
- Fully rigged Maya files (exported from Maya 2016).
- All Maya animations in .FBX format.

Animations and Skins are ready to go - just apply to the model.

Note: Do not change the scale of the Hockey Dude in the inspector, as animations are set to work with the current model. Instead, use the scale tool once dragged into your scene.
